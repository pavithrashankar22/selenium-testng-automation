# Selenium TestNG Automation

## Overview
This repository is a hands-on QA automation learning project focused on building and strengthening test automation fundamentals. The work in this repository is developed incrementally as part of continuous daily practice and learning.

The objective is to apply automation concepts, improve test design, and gradually expand coverage over time. This project is intended for learning and skill development and does not represent a production-level automation framework.
